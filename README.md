# Homographies-Particle_Filters
This repository is a practice of Homographies and Particle filters

------
## Introduction
### Homographies
- [Homography1A.ipynb](https://github.com/alstondu/Homographies-Particle_Filters/blob/main/Homographies/Homography1A.ipynb) calculates the homography that best maps two sets of points to one another.
- [Homography1B.ipynb](https://github.com/alstondu/Homographies-Particle_Filters/blob/main/Homographies/Homography1B.ipynb) builds a simple image stitcher for making panoramas.
- [Homography2A.ipynb](https://github.com/alstondu/Homographies-Particle_Filters/blob/main/Homographies/Homography2A.ipynb) explores the geometry of a single camera, building a method to estimate that transformation and a method that can project points into camera image space.
- [Homography2B.ipynb](https://github.com/alstondu/Homographies-Particle_Filters/blob/main/Homographies/Homography2B.ipynb) takes a real image containing a planar black square and figure out the transformation between the square and the camera. Then a wire-frame cube is drawn with it's base corners at the corner of the square.
### Particle_Filter
- [Particle_FilterA.ipynb](https://github.com/alstondu/Homographies-Particle_Filters/blob/main/Particle_Filter/Particle_FilterA.ipynb) implements factored sampling based on particle filters.
- [Particle_FilterB.ipynb](https://github.com/alstondu/Homographies-Particle_Filters/blob/main/Particle_Filter/Particle_FilterB.ipynb) tracks a given shape (template) as it moves in a sequence of frames.
- [Particle_FilterC.ipynb](https://github.com/alstondu/Homographies-Particle_Filters/blob/main/Particle_Filter/Particle_FilterC.ipynb) tracks the positions of the four corners of the square and project a cube into the images.
